# Algorithm X Setup

This toy example is a straightforward Algorithm X setup. What are the requirements? Each student must be assigned to a team color and each grade (age) must be represented on each team. What are the actions? Each action assigns a team color to one of the students. But, how do we make sure the siblings are always placed on the same team? Using colors to enforce sameness, of course! Letâ€™s build a solution one step at a time. At the bottom is a fully funcitonal solution if you wish to experiment further. 


# Building the All-or-None Sets

Because all siblings share identical last names, the all-or-none sets are easily built using a `dictionary` to organize the `Student`s into families. Each key is a last name and each value is a list of all the `Student`s that are part of that family.

```python
        self.families = defaultdict(list)
        for student in students:
            last_name = student.name.split()[-1]
            self.families[last_name].append(student)
```

# Requirements and Actions

Two list comprehensions capture all the requirements. 1 to 3 actions is created for each child. If the child is a captain, only one team color assignment is possible. If the child is not a captain, the child could be put on any of the 3 teams.

```python
        requirements = [('student assigned', student.name) for student in students]
        requirements += [('grade covered', grade, team_color) for grade in range(1, 7) for team_color in 'rgb']
        
        actions = dict()
        for student in students:
            possible_teams = captains[student.name] if student.name in captains else 'rgb'
            for team_color in possible_teams:
                action = ('assign student', student.name, team_color)
                actions[action] = [('student assigned', student.name), ('grade covered', student.grade, team_color)]
```

# Enforcing Sameness Using Colors

Per the [steps]( coloring-with-your-solver) outlined a few pages earlier, an attribute is added to track color assignments and the `AlgorithmXSolver` `_process_row_selection()` and `_process_row_deselection()` methods are overridden:

```python
        self.student_colors = {student.name:[] for student in students}
```

```python
    def _process_row_selection(self, row):
        _, name, team_color = row
        for sibling in self.families[name.split()[-1]]:
            if self.student_colors[sibling.name] and team_color != self.student_colors[sibling.name][-1]:
                self.solution_is_valid = False

            self.student_colors[sibling.name].append(team_color)

            
    def _process_row_deselection(self, row):
        _, name, team_color = row
        for sibling in self.families[name.split()[-1]]:
            self.student_colors[sibling.name].pop()
```

# Building Teams from a Solution

As I loop through the actions of each solution, I append the name of each student to the appropriate team color in a `dictionary`.

```python
    for solution in solver.solve():
        teams = {'r':[], 'g':[], 'b':[]}
        for _, name, team_color in solution:
            teams[team_color].append(name)
```

# The Full Solution

Putting it all together results in the following. Feel free to make changes and experiment. Most importantly, this solution is provided as a comparison to the second approach to enforcing sameness covered next: complex actions.
