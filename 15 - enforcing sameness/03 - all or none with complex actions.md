# Simple vs Complex Actions

The problem has not changed, so it makes sense the requirements remain exactly the same. However, in this approach, we will look at actions a bit differently. Previously, each action assigned a team color to one student, creating a _simple_ action that accomplished a single task. Here, each action will assign a team color to 1 or more students.

__Complex Action:__ Multiple simple actions combined into a single action.

Using simple actions, it takes 3 separate `tuple`s to assign Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson to the red team:

```python
('assign student', 'Bart Simpson', 'r')
('assign student', 'Lisa Simpson', 'r')
('assign student', 'Maggie Simpson', 'r')
```

Keep in mind, each action must be a `tuple` as it will be used as a `key` in the `actions` `dictionary`. These three simple actions could be combined into the following complex action `tuple`:

```python
(('assign student', 'Bart Simpson', 'r'), ('assign student', 'Lisa Simpson', 'r'), ('assign student', 'Maggie Simpson', 'r'))
```

Packing simple actions into a complex action can be done many ways. Ultimately, what matters is that you properly unpack the complex action `tuple` when building a solution. In the code below, I have chosen to pack simple actions into a complex action as follows:

```python
('assign students', ('Bart Simpson', 'Lisa Simpson', 'Maggie Simpson'), 'r')
```

Letâ€™s step through a full solution using complex actions one step at a time.

# What Remains the Same?

The following code blocks are identical to the code used previously:

```python
        self.families = defaultdict(list)
        for student in students:
            last_name = student.name.split()[-1]
            self.families[last_name].append(student)
```

```python
        requirements = [('student assigned', student.name) for student in students]
        requirements += [('grade covered', grade, team_color) for grade in range(1, 7) for team_color in 'rgb']
```

# Method Overrides No Longer Necessary

The `AlgorithmXSolver` `_process_row_selection()` and `_process_row_deselection()` methods no longer need to be customized. In the full solution below, you will see this shortens the code a fair amount.

# Building the Actions Dictionary

In the following code snippet, notice how the list of names for each family is put into a single action. List comprehensions are used to identify _all_ requirements satisfied by the complex action.  Each student that is part of the family adds two satisfied requirements to the list.

It is important that a family with only one child is still treated as a group of children. Every action, whether the family has 1, 2, 3 or more children, assigns a team color to all members of the family group.

```python
        actions = dict()
        for family in self.families.values():
            possible_teams = 'rgb'
            for student in family:
                if student.name in captains:
                    possible_teams = captains[student.name]
                    
            for team_color in possible_teams:
                action = ('assign students', tuple(student.name for student in family), team_color)
                actions[action] = [('student assigned', student.name) for student in family]
                actions[action] += [('grade covered', student.grade, team_color) for student in family]
```

# Building Teams from a Solution

A very minor change must be made as the actions that make up a solution are unpacked. Each action now contains a group of names. That entire group of names must be added to the proper team.

```python
    for solution in solver.solve():
        teams = {'r':[], 'g':[], 'b':[]}
        for _, names, team_color in solution:
            teams[team_color].extend(names)
```

# The Full Solution

Putting it all together results in the following. Feel free to make changes and experiment. Most importantly, this solution is provided as a comparison to the first approach to enforcing sameness covered previously: using colors.
