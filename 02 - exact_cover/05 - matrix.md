# Visualizing the Model

An exact cover problem is often displayed as a matrix. The problem requirements are listed across the top as column headers. The possible actions are listed down the left side as row headers. `1`s are placed in the appropriate boxes to indicate which requirements are covered by each action. `0`s are often placed in the other cells, but I am going to leave those cells blank in order to draw your attention to the locations of the `1`s. Let’s take a look.

The visual above should help you see where the term exact cover comes from. A proper solution is made up of a subset of rows that exactly covers all the columns. In our simple example, it is easy to see this can be accomplished by selecting rows 1, 3 and 5.

Let's eliminate the unused rows to really highlight the "exact cover".

Think about the size of the matrix for 9x9 Sudoku: 243 columns and 729 rows, yet Algorithm X easily processes a matrix of that size to find all solutions! Later in this playground, I’ll demonstrate how Algorithm X works. For now, I need you to trust me. If you can build a proper model (requirements, actions and a mapping from actions to the satisfied requirements), Algorithm X will easily find all the solutions.

In the next section, I’ll show you how to use an out-of-the-box `AlgorithmXSolver` to generate solutions for your models.
