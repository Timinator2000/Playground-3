# Strategy

The goal statement for this puzzle is so short, I will copy it all here:

>Your task is to determine how many pavings are possible for a rectangle using bricks of dimension 1 x 2 only.
>
>A paving is a way to cover all the surface with bricks (partition)

Interesting! These bricks are the same `1 x 2` shape as the dominoes we just finished arranging. This puzzle asks us to count the number of possible solutions, just like we recently did in [Constrained Latin Squares](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/constrained-latin-squares).

Put your study materials away. Keep your eyes on your own work. This is a test! Start your timer. You have 60 minutes.
