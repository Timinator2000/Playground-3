# Strategy

It should be fairly simple to use your code from [n Queens]( https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/n-queens) to create a solution for this puzzle. You need to limit the possible actions so that Algorithm X is forced to place queens on board locations prefilled with a `Q`. The hard way to do that is to completely restrict the actions to only locations on the board where a queen could be placed. I will let you figure out the easier way!
