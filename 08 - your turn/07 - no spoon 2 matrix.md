# There Is No Spoon - Episode 2 - Setting Up Algorithm X

Let's take another look at the Object-Oriented Design model. Everything Algorithm X needs is right here:

This is one of the toughest Algorithm X puzzle on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) due to the amount of multiplicity. The requirements are straightforward. Just like Ella needed some number of lessons for Mrs. Knuth – Part III, each Node needs some number of links.

<BR>

__Step 1:__ Loop through all `Node`s and create the appropriate requirements.

<BR>

Let’s dig a bit deeper into the actions. As mentioned earlier, all actions involve putting some link between two `Node`s, but what does that actually look like? Looking at the gameboard, the link must be placed in a specific slot and it needs to be tied to one of the link requirements for each `Node`. That looks like triple multiplicity, doesn’t it!

<BR>

__Step 2:__ Loop through all `Channel`s and create the appropriate actions, including the lists of requirements covered by each action. Make sure you properly handle all the multiplicity.

<BR>

What about those pesky `Intersection`s? Putting a link in a `Channel` might eliminate any possibility of putting links in a crossing `Channel`. Sounds like textbook mutual exclusivity, right? You’ll need to create optional requirements to handle all the mutual exclusivity.

<BR>

__Step 3:__ Loop through all `Intersection`s and create the appropriate optional requirements to handle all mutual exclusivity created by `Channel`s that pass through the same `Intersection`.

<BR>

__Step 4:__ Make sure all the proper `me_requirements` are added to the lists of requirements covered by the actions that cover them. If you use the code structure recommended in Mrs. Knuth – Part III, make sure you append the `me_requirements` to the rest of the `optional_requirements` before invoking the inherited `AlgorithmXSolver` constructor.

# Your Goal

Using the techniques covered so far, you can solve most of the test cases for this puzzle, but you cannot solve them all. __Test Case 8: Advanced__ and __Test Case 13: Expert__ are just too big to solve purely with backtracking. In the next section, I will cover problem-space reduction, and I’ll revisit this puzzle with a few more ideas that might help you find the finish line. Before moving on, let’s discuss a few things about the test cases you should be able to solve.

__Test Cases 1 through 7, 9 and 10:__ These can all be solved with Algorithm X by following the processes covered in the Mrs. Knuth puzzles and the guidelines given here.

__Test Cases 11 and 12:__ Algorithm X will generate multiple solutions and you will need to determine which solution has a _single connected group_ of nodes. Just like in Mrs. Knuth – Part III, this is a perfect opportunity to override the `AlgorithmXSolver` method `_process_solution(self)`. If the solution is valid, you do not need to do anything. The solver will `yield` the solution just as expected. If the solution is not valid, add the following line before exiting the method to tell Algorithm X this solution is not valid and should not be included in the solution generator.

```python
self.solution_is_valid = False
```

__You never need to specifically set this attribute back to `True`. Invalid solutions immediately cause backtracking and `AlgorithmXSolver` automatically resets this attribute to `True` every time backtracking occurs.__

In the next section, I will discuss how to solve part of a problem with logic so the task given to Algorithm X is more manageable. Much of There is No Spoon – Episode 2 can be solved with only logic, no backtracking. However, only a combination of logical problem-space reduction and backtracking can solve all test cases and validators.
