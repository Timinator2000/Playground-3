# A Sudoku Data Structure

A few pages ago, I intentionally drew the original Sudoku grid as 81 disconnected cells to create the perception of each cell being a standalone entity, or object. Since each cell is a standalone object, I can put a pointer to that cell into each group to which it belongs. I will demonstrate how to do this with Sudoku, and later I will give an overview of how this same general structure can be used on several other puzzles.

Conceptually, I create two classes, one for a `SudokuCell` and another for a `SudokuGroup`. The `SudokuGroup` will have an attribute that is a list of pointers to the 9 `SudokuCell`s that are part of that group.

In the interest of code reuse across all Sudoku puzzles, my SudokuSolver will require the following:

1. Unknown cells must use a `.` to indicate an unknown cell. Some puzzles use a `0` which is easy to fix with a call to `str.replace('0', '.')`.
    
1. All cell values will be treated as characters.

1. `all_possible_values` will be a string of all characters found in the Sudoku.

Let's make the conceptual classes a bit more concrete. First, a class for an individual cell:

```python
UNKNOWN = '.'

class SudokuCell():

    def __init__(self, value: str, all_possible_values: str):
        self.value = value
        self.candidates = set(all_possible_values) if value == UNKNOWN else {value}

    def reduce_(self, unavailable_values: set):
        # your code goes here – make sure all unavailable_values are removed from the candidates
```

<BR>

Second, a class for a Sudoku group:

```python
class SudokuGroup():

    def __init__(self):
        self.cells = []

    def reduce_(self):
        # your reducing code goes here
```

<BR>

Next, in the constructor of my `SudokuSolver` class, I use a dictionary comprehension to create an instance of a `SudokuCell` for each location in the grid. Using the `(row, col)` tuple as the dictionary key makes it easy to get a pointer to a cell as the groups are built.

```python
class SudokuSolver(AlgorithmXSolver):

    def __init__(self, grid: List[List[str]], all_possible_values: str):

        # Calculate size and box size so that one class works for different size Sudokus.
        size = len(grid)
        box_size = int(size ** 0.5)

        self.grid = {(r, c): SudokuCell(grid[r][c], all_possible_values) for r in range(size) for c in range(size)}

```

It would have been just as easy to create a two-dimensional array of `SudokuCell` instances. I chose to use a dictionary to hold the cells to intentionally blur the visual of a Sudoku grid. I find it beneficial to think in terms of rows, columns and boxes as compared to maintaining the visual of a two-dimensional grid.

Continuing in the constructor, I create a list of `SudokuGroup`s for the rows, another for the columns and a third for the boxes.

```python
        rows = [SudokuGroup() for _ in range(size)]
        cols = [SudokuGroup() for _ in range(size)]
        boxes = [SudokuGroup() for _ in range(size)]
```

The last setup step is to put all the cells into the groups to which they belong. The values of `self.grid` are all pointers to instances of `SudokuCell`s. After the following code executes, we are left with 3 lists of 9 groups, each group having a list of pointers to the cells that make up that group. Because of the pointers, a change to one cell is seen by all groups to which that cell belongs.

```python
        for row in range(size):
            for col in range(size):
                box = row // box_size * box_size + col // box_size
                cell = self.grid[(row, col)]

                rows[row].cells.append(cell)
                cols[col].cells.append(cell)
                boxes[box].cells.append(cell)
```

<BR>

I cannot emphasize enough how powerful this pointer-based structure can be. In an object-oriented approach, objects have relationships with other objects. Despite any bad memories the word "pointer" might stir up, Python makes pointers very straightforward and pointers are a very common way for one object to "have a relationship" with another object.

# A Short Algorithm to Facilitate Problem-Space Reduction

Before exiting the constructor, the last task is to loop over all 27 groups, one at a time, reducing the problem space where possible.

```python
        need_to_reduce = True
        while need_to_reduce:
            need_to_reduce = False
            for group in rows + cols + boxes:
                if group.reduce_():
                    need_to_reduce = True
```

The `while` loop will continue as long as at least one group is able to reduce the problem space in some way. Only after all 27 groups indicate no reduction is possible does the code exit the `while` loop and if any cells remain unknown, I’m sure you know what comes next - building the requirements and actions for Algorithm X.

# How Much Reducing is Necessary?

This framework will get you going in a good direction, but there is still a lot of code to write. You may have already completed all the Sudoku puzzles using Algorithm X, but there is a lot to be learned if you take on the challenge of solving those puzzles again, using only logic this time. Fortunately, Sudoku has been well studied and a simple Google search results in many strategies for solving a Sudoku by hand.

On the next page, I'll give you a few hints as to what is possible on all the Sudoku puzzles using only logical, problem-space reduction. Later in the playground, I will explore several puzzles that require a bit of problem-space reduction before backtracking begins if you hope to find solutions within the given time.
