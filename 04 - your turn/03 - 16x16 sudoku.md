Everything you need to know about this puzzle has already been covered in the section on 9x9 Sudoku. However, I do want to add a few comments.

I provided a fair amount of input to @yoch when this puzzle was reviewed and approved. Although this puzzle is straightforward if solved with Algorithm X, it is also a nice challenge without Algorithm X. Non-Algorithm-X solutions that work for 9x9 grids might not work on these 16x16 grids. A more significant algorithm is required to solve the larger puzzles, making for a very worthwhile learning experience.
